My introduction to GitHub

Hello all!

My name is Carlos, and I am an Electrical Engineering student at Eastern Washington University set to graduate August 2019!
During my time as a student I found an interest in coding and software design. I was introduced to machine learning, a branch
of EE that I really enjoyed and would like to pursue further. I also took an introductory VHDL course and was fascinated how 
circuit testing and programming can work together.
